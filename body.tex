\section{Exploration of Applications}
\subsection{The Heat Equation}
Fourier Analysis was first discovered when Joseph Fourier first developed the Heat Equation. The Heat Equation models the flow of heat along a certain heat profile over time. In this example, a 1D solution will be derived and solved.

\subsubsection{Brief Derivation}
\(\alpha\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod.
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} \]

\subsubsection{Application of the Fourier Transform}
