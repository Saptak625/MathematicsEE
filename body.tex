\section{Exploration of Applications}
\subsection{The Heat Equation}
Fourier Analysis was first discovered when Joseph Fourier first developed the Heat Equation. The Heat Equation models the flow of heat along a certain heat profile over time. In this example, a 1D solution will be derived and solved.
