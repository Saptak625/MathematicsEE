\section{ODE Simplification}
% TODO: Add ODE Simplfication Examples
A primary application of Fourier Analysis is to simplify higher-order ODE systems into lower-order ODE systems. This can greatly reduce the complexity of the problem and can allow for either simpler analytical solutions or numerical solutions using Euler's Method or Runge-Kutta methods. The following examples aim to illustrate this application of Fourier Analysis \citep{Libretexts_2021b}.

\section{PDE to ODE Reduction}
Furthermore, the Fourier Transform serves as a powerful mathematical tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enabling the reduction of complex PDE systems to simpler ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Consequently, the system's complexity diminishes, paving the way for more manageable ODEs. This reduction not only facilitates the exploration of analytical solutions but also enhances the feasibility of employing numerical techniques like Euler's Method or Runge-Kutta methods for efficient computation. The utilization of Fourier Transform in this context offers a valuable approach to gaining deeper insights into the behavior and dynamics of various systems, making it a fundamental tool in the study of differential equations as shown by the following examples \citep{danchin2005fourier}.
